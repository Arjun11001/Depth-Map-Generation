# Depth-Map-Generation
Web app for depth map generation(using ml-depth-pro by Apple): upload an image, get a colorized depth map with real distance and focal length, using a Figma-designed UI and deep learning backend.

The video file "depth_map_process.mp4" provides a walkthrough of the project, from design and execution to the final result.
